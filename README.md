## Hi There 👋

I'm Kami:
A full-stack developer with hands-on experience building software applications using Java, Spring Boot, React, HTML,
CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and PostgreSQL. I’m skilled in Agile methodologies, Git, and unit/integration testing. I thrive
on solving real-world problems through clean, maintainable code with thoughtful UX.

Before transitioning into tech, I spent five years as an educator, helping students grow through personalized, data
driven instruction. I'm also deeply curious about AI and its potential to transform business workflows and software
development, especially in areas like automation, personalization, and intelligent decision-making. I’m passionate
about creating innovative solutions that support learning, collaboration, and impact.
